## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

A challenge I faced in creating this submission is that I was having a hard time in adding photos for the buttons as backgrounds. It was because I did not know how to hide the pictures and then to show those pictures when the buttons were clicked.using HTML and CSS. I was confused about how I could add the pictures in HTML and set them as the background for the buttons because I could not hide the pictures the way I used for the start and end buttons. After I searched it up, I knew that while HTML could help me add the pictures on the buttons, it would be inefficient when it came to setting these photos as backgrounds and to make them hidden. It is because it would require more work to do that, and there would be more lines of code. I also found a source that stated about how I could do that with CSS; therefore, I decided to use the CSS properties to work with the URLs of the images, and the images shown up as the buttonsâ€™ backgrounds perfectly. Then, I used the knowledge that I got from the instruction to make the pictures only show up when the buttons were clicked on.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

My first question is that once we created a website, where and how can we host our website so that the actual players can play? I did some research about this, but I have never had a chance to publish a website before. I am curious what the process will be like.  Another question I want to ask is if the work of publishing the project on the server belongs to the web developer? I heard that there are many positions in a company, so I wonder if there is any position that will do the work of publishing websites. I also wonder what the exact work of the web developers is. I read many sources, but each source gives a different view, so I want to collect as many sights as possible about this so that I can have a better idea about web development.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would add additional features such as adding a ticking clock or using audio clips instead of using a single tone for each button. Regarding a ticking clock, it can both help the players know how much time they have left and be a small push to the players to rush in guessing. This detail will make the game more difficult. Besides, using alternative sound effects will make the game have various colors of music. In other words, I would love to make the game have more popular pieces of music. This will make the game more interesting to the player. I also want to add a celebrating fireworks effect, worrying-face effect, or crying-face for the players when they win, incorrectly guess, or lose respectively. If I still had a few more hours after these mentioned additional effects, I want to combine the pick-up pairs game to this game as a higher level. The players then will need to both memorize the sequence of the game and memorize which two buttons play the same sounds in order to clear or hide the buttons of the play screen. If the players are able to clear or hide every button, the players will win. After the players finish their game, the game will start from the beginning with full buttons as before. These are additional features that I would add to the game if I had more time.
